        <p>Frequently held misconceptions regarding electric cars (EVs) are caused by a lack of knowledge and comprehension of the technology. To spread accurate information and boost EV adoption, it's critical to address these myths. The following are a few of the most widespread myths:</p>

        <h3>Limited Range</h3>
        <p>Numerous individuals think that electric vehicles (EVs) are only good for short trips because of their extremely low driving ranges. Modern EVs provide a range that can match or even exceed that of many gasoline-powered automobiles, in contrast to the early EV models' constrained driving ranges. In the present day, some EVs may travel far over 300 miles on a single charge.</p>

        <h3>Long Charging Times</h3>
        <p>Some people think EVs are unsuitable for daily use because they require extremely long charging times. Even though charging periods vary depending on the charger type and EV model, fast chargers enable many EVs to be charged to a sizeable portion of their capacity in under an hour, and overnight home charging is practical for daily use.</p>

        <h3>Lack of Charging Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>There is a widespread misperception that there is a lack of charging infrastructure, making it challenging to locate charging stations. In actuality, there are a lot of charging stations available, especially in urban areas, as charging networks have grown dramatically in recent years.</p>
